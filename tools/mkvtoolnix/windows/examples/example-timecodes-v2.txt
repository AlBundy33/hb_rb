# timecode format v2

# The very first line MUST have this format.

# As you can see empty lines and other lines starting with '#' are ignored.

# The remaining lines simply contain the timecode in ms for the following
# frame. The number can be a floating point number, but it doesn't have to
# be. Note that only dots ('.') are accepted as the decimal point, not
# commas!

# White spaces are ignored.

# You must give at least as many timecode lines here as the track contais
# frames. Otherwise mkvmerge will complain, and the results might not be
# what you expect.

# Example for 10 consecutive frames at 25fps:
0
40.0
80.0
120
160
200
240
280
320
360

# No need to use floats, but you can if you want. Now some more frames which
# are spaced a bit more.
460
560
660
760
860
960
1060
